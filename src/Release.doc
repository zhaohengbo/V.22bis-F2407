release v063

- CID and CID_Status under interrupt (_Fdisconnect in Main.asm)

release v063w1

- correct connect problem for V22 answer at high level (v22b.c)
- transmit gains V23 set to ~ -10 dBm (param.h)

release v063w2

- correct connect problem in V22 answer (V22bis mode) (v22b.c)
- add ATS0= , ATS0?, automatic answer (mainc.c, cid.c)

release	v063w3

- modify carrier detect condition in answer to 3dB step (V22b.c)
- modify connection timer in V21 to fix first erroneous character
 problem (V21V23.c line 103)
- modify V23 carrier detection threshold (param.h)

release v063w4

- protect sample IT by masking SDINT in IMR (in order to prevent RESET
in case of MIPS overrun, problem occured in V21) in main.asm

- put StartUart() after delay of 25 ms for AGC convergence (V21V23.c)
- increase NSM for smooth carrier lost

release v063w5

-bug fix in V.21 answering, no SendFSK (tone generation), directly go to UART (v21v23.c),
same bug fix for V.23 answering
-timing for AGC convergence reset to 20ms for V.21 (v21v23.c)
-protect CID changes: Before starting a new mode with initialization, etc.  
 the variable CID has to be set to NoMode or interrupts have to be disabled 
 (CID changes: CID->CPTD, CPTD->V22bis/V22, CPTD->V21, CPTD->V23)
 in files call.c, v22b.c, v21v23.c
-bug fix in V.21 calling and answering: add initialization of transmit Uart
 and receive Uart: call _InitScram, call StartUart0 (TXFSK.asm)
 Transmit Uart enabled when CID set to V21, receive Uart enabled after carrier detection
-same bug fix for V.23

release v064w5

- 8khz V22bis calling transmit ok
- 8kHz calling receive: AGC close to final, cosine branch ok, sine branch ?

release v64w6

- 8kHz calling receive sine branch seems ok
- amplitude a little too low
- received data wrong
- trace mode and dram active
- inversion branch sinus, reglage gain -> ok

release v64w7

- correct low pass filter after demodulation for 8kHz
- ok demodulation 8kHz calling
- problem in carrier detect, answering
- trace mode and dram active, 12 mips

release	v064w8

- suppress RSCNTR
- correct bug in TMRCVC.ASM line 112 (TIMIND)
- tune carrier detect
- test BER at -43
- receive with no error down to -55dBm; -6dBm max

release v64w9

- error in management of tone generation; no intialisation
 in answering mode; no call to InitTot();
- error in timing in V22b.c; before V22/V22bis timing are at 8kHz,
 after,	they are at 1kHz
- error in timing for 2100Hz; timing are in 9.6kHz and not in 8kHz
- (demod.asm) error in end of sOrigin4 (ModemIn loading)
- (v22b.c) return 0 at the end of FV22b (line 280)
- level of guard tone too high
- adjusted transmit level
- V22/V22bis ok for calling and answer
- lack of eint before modulation in V22it.asm line 78
- 7.2mips full load ok

release v065

-change filter coefficients for dial tone filter in order to
 obtain larger detection band

release f066

- ok for DSK 320f206
- not cleaned
- flag IsDsk=1; means that software is configured for DSK f206
- flag CBacc=1; means that instruction code has been added to test bacc instructions

release V067

- (initdsk.asm) line 37: suppress monitor option, correct PMST error.
- (initdsk.asm) end : supress AIC test routine (.if 0)
- (initdsk.asm) begin and line 96: suppress unused Stack.

release V067B

- (mainc.c) line 360: correct release number
			line 103: suppress unused lines
			line 360: enable mips display for 58c8x
